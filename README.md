## ✨ Features

### 🚀 Intelligent Autocompletion
Type CLI commands naturally, and the plugin will suggest the next available keywords, parameters, and options based on the official documentation structure.

- Supports over **2,700 commands** from AOS 8.10.R04.
- Context-aware suggestions (e.g., typing `show ip` suggests `interface`, `route`, `ospf`...).

### 📖 Built-in Command Reference
Need to know what a command does or its exact syntax?
- Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P`) and run **"Search AOS R8 Command"**.
- Instantly search the full CLI database.
- View detailed information including:
    - **Description**
    - **Syntax**
    - **Parameters & Descriptions**
    - **Usage Guidelines**
    - **Examples**
    - **Output Definitions** (for show commands)

### 🎨 Syntax Highlighting
Automatically highlights AOS CLI syntax in code blocks for better readability.

```aosr8
! This is a comment
ip interface "Vlan1" address 192.168.1.1 mask 255.255.255.0 vlan 1
show ip interface
```

To use it, simply use the language tag `aosr8` in your code blocks:

```aosr8
show lanpower ni-priority
```
